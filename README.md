🚀 Hello Github Family! 🚀

After a long development process, I'd like to share with you a project I developed using React and Supabase! The name of my project is "Today I Learned," and I'd like to briefly share with you what I've accomplished in this project:

🔍 Project Description: "Today I Learned" is a platform where users can share daily knowledge and facts. Users can share information based on different categories and allow other users to vote on these pieces of information.

1️⃣ React Hooks: I effectively utilized useState and useEffect hooks.
2️⃣ Data Management: I integrated Supabase for database management and optimized data handling.
3️⃣ User Interface Design: I applied CSS and UI design principles to create a user-friendly interface.
